I am a Ph.D. student working with Prof. [Nathan Lepora](https://lepora.com/) and Dr. [Dandan Zhang](https://www.intelligentrobotics-acrossscales.com/) at [the University of Bristol](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/yijiong-lin), UK. My research mainly focuses on the intersection of Robotics and Machine Learning. Specifically, my current research interests lie in these topics: Robotic Manipulation, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Tactile Sensing, Physics Simulation, and Sim-to-Real.

I obtained my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering and Automation at the Guangdong University of Technology in 2017, supervised by Prof. [Yisheng Guan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37402001000) and Dr. [Juan Rojas](http://www.juanrojas.net/). During my master's period, I worked with Prof. [Paul Weng](https://weng.fr/) at the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute as a visiting student and later conducted a one-year research project on Reinforcement Learning. I did my Master's thesis on Highly-efficient Robot Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning.
