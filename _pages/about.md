I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/), University of Bristol, UK. I am currently working on the [ARIA-funded]((https://www.aria.org.uk/)) project [*'Democratising Co-Design of Hardware and Control for Robot Dexterity'*](https://www.aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/smarter-robot-bodies/robot-dexterity/meet-the-creators) project in the [Robot Dexterity program](https://www.aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/smarter-robot-bodies/robot-dexterity/), led by Prof. [Nathan Lepora](https://lepora.com/) and Prof. [Edward Johns](https://www.robot-learning.uk/) (Imeprial College London). My research focuses on developing multimodal sensing and sim-to-real deep reinforcement learning methods for dexterous robotic manipulation.

I recieved my Ph.D. degree in Engineering Mathematics in 2025 from [the University of Bristol](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/yijiong-lin), UK, under the supervision of Prof. [Nathan Lepora](https://lepora.com/), Dr. [Efi Psomopoulou](https://efipsom.github.io/), and Dr. [Dandan Zhang](https://www.intelligentrobotics-acrossscales.com/). My doctoral research is *'Sim-to-Real Deep Tactile Policies for Dexterous Robotic Manipulation'*. Prior to that, I obtained my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering and Automation at the Guangdong University of Technology in 2020, supervised by Prof. [Yisheng Guan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37402001000) and Dr. [Juan Rojas](http://www.juanrojas.net/). During my master's period, I worked with Prof. [Paul Weng](https://weng.fr/) at the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute as a visiting student and later conducted a one-year research project on Reinforcement Learning. I did my Master's thesis on Highly-efficient Robot Learning with Deep Reinforcement Learning.

In my free time, you can catch me playing badminton, swimming, or exploring urban and natural views with my lovely camera ([some selections](https://www.flickr.com/photos/193186347@N02/)). I'm also a cat person. :smile_cat:
